# cpp-Module00
Welcome to the C++ Module 00 exercises! 
This project contains multiple exercises designed to help learn and practice C++ programming.

## Introduction
This project is part of the C++ Module 00, focusing on teaching C++ fundamentals through hands-on exercises.
Each exercise addresses specific topics and concepts.

## Exercise Descreption
### Exercise 00: Megaphone
This exercise requires to create a C++ program that simulates a megaphone by converting text input to uppercase.
It's designed to help practice basic C++ command-line argument handling and string manipulation.
### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook
In this exercise, the task is creating a simple phonebook application in C++. 
The program should accept user commands (ADD, SEARCH, or EXIT) and manage a list of contacts. 
It can store up to 8 contacts, and when a ninth contact is added, it should replace the oldest contact. 
The program must display contacts in a specific format when the SEARCH command is used.
### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams
This exercise envolves a header file (Account.hpp) and a test file (tests.cpp). 
The task is to create an implementation file (Account.cpp) to complete the missing source code for an "Account" class. 
It demends to ensure that the provided tests in tests.cpp pass with the correct output. 
The exercise makes practice to write C++ class implementations.
